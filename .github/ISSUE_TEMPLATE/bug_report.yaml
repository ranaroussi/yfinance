        # !!! IMPORTANT !!! FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY !!!

        ### Are you up-to-date?

        Upgrade to the latest version: `$ pip install yfinance --upgrade --no-cache-dir`

        Confirm latest version by running: `import yfinance as yf ; print(yf.__version__)` and comparing against [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/#history).

        ### Does Yahoo actually have the data?

        Are you spelling symbol *exactly* same as Yahoo?

        Then visit `finance.yahoo.com` and confirm they have the data you want. Maybe your symbol was delisted, or your expectations of `yfinance` are wrong.

        ### Are you spamming Yahoo?

        Yahoo Finance free service has rate-limiting https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance/discussions/1513. Once limit hit, Yahoo can delay, block, or return bad data -> not a `yfinance` bug.
        
        ### Does issue already exist?

        Use the search tool. Don't duplicate existing issues.
