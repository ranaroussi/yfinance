# 1 Introduction

The Test Plan has been created to communicate the test approach to team members. It includes the objectives, scope, schedule, risks and approach. This document will clearly identify what the test deliverables will be and what is deemed in and out of scope.

# 2 Scope

# 3 Assumptions/Risk

## 3.1 Assumptions

## 3.2 Risks

## 3.3 Problems found during research

# 4 Test Approach

We will use unit testing to test the functionalities of the piece of code assigned to us. More specifically, we will use black box testing to test whether the function behaves abnormally, whether there are errors in the data structure, whether the performance of the function are satisfied, etc. A test case sheet will be created for each test case identified during planning and added to Github.

## 4.1 Test Automation

Automated unit tests are part of the development process, but no automated functional tests are planned at this time.

# 5 Test Environment

Python 3.7 or later is required for running the application. The Python unittest library should also be installed in order to run the unit test files.
