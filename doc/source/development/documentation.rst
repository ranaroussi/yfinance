About documentation
------------------------
* yfinance documentation is written in reStructuredText (rst) and built using Sphinx.
* The documentation file is in `doc/source/..`.
* Most of the notes under API References read from class and methods docstrings. These documentations, found in `doc/source/reference/api` is autogenerated by Sphinx and not included in git.

Building documentation locally
-------------------------------
To build the documentation locally, follow these steps:

1. **Install Required Dependencies**:

   * Make sure `Sphinx` and any other dependencies are installed. If a `requirements.txt` file is available, you can install dependencies by running:
   
   .. code-block:: console

      pip install -r requirements.txt
   

2. **Build with Sphinx**:
    
   * After dependencies are installed, use the sphinx-build command to generate HTML documentation. 
   * Go to `doc/` directory Run:

   .. code-block:: console

      make clean && make html 

3. **View Documentation Locally**:

   * Open `doc/build/html/index.html` in the browser to view the generated documentation.

Building documentation on main 
-------------------------------
The documentation updates are built on merge to `main` branch. This is done via GitHub Actions workflow based on `/yfinance/.github/workflows/deploy_doc.yml`.

1. Reivew the changes locally and push to `dev`.

2. When `dev` gets merged to `main`, GitHub Actions workflow is automated to build documentation.
