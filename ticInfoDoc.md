EBITDA MARGIN - The EBITDA margin is a measure of a company's operating profit as a percentage of its revenue.
The acronym EBITDA stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Knowing the EBITDA margin
allows for a comparison of one company's real performance to others in its industry.

PROFIT MARGIN - Profit margin is one of the commonly used profitability ratios to gauge the degree to which a company
or a business activity makes money. It represents what percentage of sales has turned into profits. Simply put,
the percentage figure indicates how many cents of profit the business has generated for each dollar of sale. For instance,
if a business reports that it achieved a 35% profit margin during the last quarter, it means that it had a net income of 
$0.35 for each dollar of sales generated.

GROSS MARGIN - Gross margin is net sales less the cost of goods sold (COGS). In other words, it's the amount of money a
company retains after incurring the direct costs associated with producing the goods it sells and the services it provides.
The higher the gross margin, the more capital a company retains, which it can then use to pay other costs or satisfy debt
obligations. The net sales figure is gross revenue, less the returns, allowances, and discounts

OPERATING CASH FLOW - The operating cash flow ratio is a measure of how readily current liabilities are covered by the cash
flows generated from a company's operations. This ratio can help gauge a company's liquidity in the short term.

REVENUE GROWTH - Quarterly revenue growth is an increase in a company's sales in one quarter compared to sales of a
different quarter. The current quarter's sales figure can be compared on a year-over-year basis
(e.g., 3Q sales of Year 1 compared with 3Q sales of Year 2) or sequentially (3Q sales of Year 1 compared with 4Q sales
of Year 1). This gives analysts, investors, and additional stakeholders an idea of how much a company's sales are increasing
over time.

OPERATING MARGIN - The operating margin measures how much profit a company makes on a dollar of sales after paying for
variable costs of production, such as wages and raw materials, but before paying interest or tax. It is calculated by
dividing a company’s operating income by its net sales. Higher ratios are generally better, illustrating the company is
efficient in its operations and is good at turning sales into profits.

EBITDA - EBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, is an alternate measure of
profitability to net income. By stripping out the non-cash depreciation and amortization expense as well as taxes
and debt costs dependent on the capital structure, EBITDA attempts to represent cash profit generated by the company’s
operations

projected and historical earnings. When an analyst raises their price target for a stock, they generally expect the stock
price to rise.

GROSS PROFIT - Gross profit is the profit a company makes after deducting the costs associated with making and selling its
products, or the costs associated with providing its services. Gross profit will appear on a company's income statement and
can be calculated by subtracting the cost of goods sold (COGS) from revenue (sales). These figures can be found on a
company's income statement. Gross profit may also be referred to as sales profit or gross income.
